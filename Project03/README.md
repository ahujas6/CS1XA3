My project is a game which uses Elm for Client side, I have named it GameHub .
The objective of the game is to increase your focus and reaction time. The game feature 2 balls depending on game mode you either need to pass through it or avoid it, the balls appear at totally random places and in random sizes,
The points are provided for passing through the required ball depending on mode , and points are inversely proportional to size of ball.
#### It features 2 modes
